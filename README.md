# AirCanvas
Air Canvas is an innovative application that enables users to draw and create art using hand gestures tracked by a camera. This project eliminates the need for traditional drawing tools, leveraging computer vision and hand-tracking techniques to provide an intuitive and interactive drawing experience.
